Arabic:(Hikmat Abu Zayd 


pronounced Hekmat Abu Zeid 
in Egyptian Arabic; 
1922 or 1923 – 30 July 2011)[N][3] 
was an Egyptian 
politician and academic. She became the first female 
cabinet minister in Egypt in 1962.[4] 
Her tenure as 
minister of social affairs set a precedent. Afterwards, it 
became common for women to head that ministry.[5] 
An avowed advocate of Nasserism,[6] 
Abu Zayd has 
had a major impact on Egyptian law and policy in the 


[7] 


areas of social affairs and insurance. 


Early life and education 


Born in the village of Shaykh Daud, located near the 
city of al-Qusiyya 
in Asyut Governorate, Abu Zayd 
grew up in a nationalist 
household. Her father's job at 
the Egyptian State Railways 
meant that he was 
assigned to many stations and was constantly on the 
move. Although her mother was illiterate, Abu Zayd 
was encouraged to read and was given 
access to her 
father's large library.[6] 
Abu Zayd received an 
advanced education. After completing her secondary 
education 
at the Helwan Girls School, she obtained a 
licence 
in history 
from Cairo University 
(then named 
Fuad I University) in 1940. She progressed further in 
her academic studies by receiving a teaching certificate 
in 1941, a Master of Arts 
in education in 1950 from the 
University of St Andrews, and finally a doctorate 
in 
educational psychology 
from the University of London 
in 1957. She taught in the Women's College of Ain 
Shams University 
from 1955 to 1964, before being 
promoted to the rank of professor 
at Cairo University 
in 1965.[6] 


Tenure as minister 


In 1962, Abu Zayd sat on the preparatory committee 
for the National Congress of Popular Forces. During 
her membership of the committee, she

disagreement with President 
Gamal Abdel Nasser 
over 
some sections in the Charter of National Action. 
Impressed, Nasser decided to appoint her as a 
minister.[8] 
On 29 September 1962, Abu Zayd was 
named minister of social affairs in Ali Sabri's first 
government.[9] 
She retained her role when the cabinet 
was reshuffled in March 1964,[10] 
and served until 
1965.[11] 


Abu Zayd was part of a new female leadership that 
shared the same lower middle class 
background of

Nasser and his fellow Free Officers.

appointment by Nasser was made in the context of his new socialist 
program, which put emphasis on broadening access to education and 
employment for all people, regardless of gender or social class.[5] 
The 
1950s and especially the 1960s were a time of increased female 
emancipation in Egypt.[13] 
Polygyny 
was on the decline, 
and women 
were increasingly holding key posts in government, industry and 
academia.[14] 
The country's first two female parliamentarians, Rawya 
Ateya 
and Amina Shukri, were elected in 1957.[15] 
Karimah al-Sa'id 
became the deputy minister of education in the 1960s. Such high-
level appointments of a few well-qualified women were showcased 
by the government, while the majority of Egyptian women remained 
stuck in the lower echelons of society.[5] 
Nasser's appointment of Abu Zayd was 
a politically significant 
move. Including a woman in the cabinet was a way for him to co-opt female-run charitable organizations 
into the Arab Socialist Union 
(ASU), the country's newly formed sole political party.[16] 
Many of these 
associations were headed by women from prominent families and were protective of their independence, 
which Nasser found objectionable. His regime targeted women's organizations in the early 1960s and 
moved to take over most of their functions as state responsibilities, thereby depriving the associations of 
their momentum and autonomy. Abu Zayd implemented these policies, which were aimed at benefiting 
female workers and 
peasants.[17] 
The Ministry of Social Affairs which she headed was increasingly 
specializing in women's issues.[12] 
In 1963, it organized a general and wide-ranging women's conference 
to discuss, among other things, ways to increase female economic productivity, working women's leading 
role in spreading family planning, as well as the rise of family income through the employment of female 
members. Abu Zayd was named to preside over the conference, thereby cementing her status as leader of 
the women's movement 
in Egypt.[12] 
She became coordinator for women's activities within the Arab 
Socialist Union in 1963,[6] at a time when the party had nearly 250,000 female members.[14] 


During her time in office, Abu Zayd worked on several different social issues. She strongly supported a 
law that prohibited Islamic oral repudiation 
and made it mandatory for a husband to go to court to be able 
to divorce his wife.[18] 
In order to combat mendicity, she imposed prison terms on recidivist beggars who 
returned to begging after they had received state-sponsored training in handicrafts.[19] 
In addition to 
registering NGOs 
and expanding their development activities, she launched projects aimed at improving 
the status of rural women.[20] 
One of the most sensitive tasks assigned to Abu Zayd was the relocation of 
thousands of Nubians, displaced 
by the construction of the Aswan Dam, to 
newly built villages. Her 
management of the resettlement process led to her being nicknamed 
the "Merciful Heart of the 


HekmatAbuZaidmeetingGermancounterpartElisabethSchwarzhauptinBonn,
September1963



Revolution" by Nasser.[8] 
Nevertheless, the Nubians' forced displacement 
remains controversial in Egypt 
to this day, with some blaming Nasser for the neglectful conditions in which the relocated Nubians have 
been living since then.[20] 


On a personal level, Abu Zayd faced domestic problems during her tenure as minister. Her husband was 
resentful of her responsibility-laden role and of the amount of time she spent outside the house. Their 
previously modest lifestyle changed considerably as she hired a 12-year-old houseboy 
and was provided a 
chauffeur-driven car by the government.[21] 


Exile in Libya 


Following Nasser's death in 1970 and Anwar Sadat's ascension to the presidency, Abu Zayd's career 
progression was blocked. She moved to Libya 
with her husband in 1974.[6] 
Her Nasserist convictions 
were in line with the anti-colonialism, anti-Zionism 
and pan-Arabism 
of Libya's leader Muammar 
Gaddafi.[8] 
Abu Zayd spent nearly two decades in Libya, during which time she taught political science 
at 
Al Fateh University 
in Tripoli.[20] 
She also penned articles and made speeches denouncing the Egyptian 
government.[6] 


Abu Zayd began criticizing President Sadat in the mid-1970s. She became a leader of the Egyptian 
National Front, which was set up in Damascus 
in 1980 by General Saad El Shazly. The organization 
called for the overthrow of Sadat's government.[22] 
Due to her opposition to Sadat's peace overture to 
Israel, Abu Zayd was accused of high treason, terrorism 
and spying, and was consequently deprived of 
her Egyptian nationality.[8] 
This turned her into 
a stateless 
political refugee.[20] 
A 
long legal battle ensued, 
which was finally resolved in late 1991 when a judge ruled that Abu Zayd and her husband were entitled 
to their Egyptian passports.[6] She was also acquitted of the charges of high treason and terrorism.[8][20] 


Later years and death 


After having recovered their nationality, Abu Zayd and her husband came back to Egypt in March 
1992.[6] 
She was treated as a VIP 
upon her return, and rushed to visit Nasser's mausoleum.[8] 
During the 
1990s, she 
opposed 
the Gulf War, the Madrid Peace Conference, as well as Zionism and American 
imperialism. She wrote articles for al-Osboa 
newspaper in 1998 dealing with the issues of Western 
imperialism and Arab unity.[6] 
In late 2010, she was hospitalized at the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo 
to receive treatment for her bone fractures.[20] 
Farkhonda Hassan 
visited her there on behalf of then First 
Lady Suzanne Mubarak.[23] 
During her stay at the hospital, Abu Zayd granted an interview to Almasry 
Alyoum newspaper in which she defended Nasser's legacy and lamented the loss of tolerance in Egypt.[20] 


Abu Zayd died in Cairo on 30 July 2011.[3] 


Awards 



Abu Zayd received the Lenin Peace Prize in December 1970.[24]
